# Analyze-ICE-Hockey
create a real-time AI solution using CodeProject.AI to analyze a 180-degree fisheye camera feed for ice hockey gameplay. The goal is to autonomously track and follow the action on the ice by controlling a PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera mounted on a gimbal, similar to the Pix4Team robot gimbal. Responsibilities: • Develop an AI model that can detect and follow ice hockey gameplay in real time from a 180-degree fisheye camera. • Integrate CodeProject.AI for action detection, player tracking, and movement prediction. • Program the PTZ gimbal controls to dynamically follow the puck and players, ensuring smooth and responsive tracking of key action areas on the ice. • Optimize for low latency and high accuracy to ensure real-time tracking, even with fast-paced gameplay. • Fine-tune the solution for outdoor and indoor rinks with varying lighting and environmental conditions. Requirements: • Proven experience with CodeProject.AI or similar AI frameworks for video analysis. • Strong background in computer vision and deep learning, specifically object detection and tracking. • Experience with PTZ camera control and programming for real-time applications. • Familiarity with fisheye camera video correction techniques. • Ability to work with and integrate 180-degree fisheye lens distortion into tracking algorithms. • Experience working on sports-related tracking systems is a plus. If you have the expertise to bring this project to life, please apply with a portfolio or examples of relevant projects. We are seeking an experienced AI Developer to create a real-time tracking system for ice hockey using CodeProject.AI. The ideal candidate will implement algorithms to track players and the puck effectively, integrating with PTZ gimbal control for seamless camera movement. Your expertise will help enhance the viewing experience for fans and analysts alike.
--------------
Creating a real-time AI solution to analyze ice hockey gameplay from a 180-degree fisheye camera feed and control a PTZ camera involves several steps. Below is an outline of the Python code structure and key components needed for such a system. This code assumes you're using CodeProject.AI for AI functionalities and have access to a PTZ camera API for control.
Step 1: Set Up the Environment

Make sure to install the required libraries:

bash

pip install opencv-python numpy requests

Step 2: Code Structure

Here’s a sample implementation outline for tracking players and the puck:
2.1 Import Required Libraries

python

import cv2
import numpy as np
import requests
from codeproject_ai import AIModel  # Hypothetical import for CodeProject.AI

2.2 Define PTZ Camera Control Functions

python

def control_ptz_camera(pan_angle, tilt_angle, zoom_level):
    # Replace with actual PTZ camera control API endpoint
    url = "http://your-ptz-camera-api/control"
    data = {
        "pan": pan_angle,
        "tilt": tilt_angle,
        "zoom": zoom_level
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Failed to control PTZ camera:", response.text)

2.3 Initialize the AI Model

python

def initialize_ai_model():
    model = AIModel("path_to_your_model")  # Initialize your AI model from CodeProject.AI
    return model

2.4 Process Video Feed

python

def process_video_feed(camera_feed):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(camera_feed)

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        # Correct fisheye distortion if necessary
        corrected_frame = correct_fisheye_distortion(frame)
        
        # Analyze frame for action detection
        detections = model.detect(corrected_frame)

        # Extract player and puck positions from detections
        player_positions, puck_position = extract_positions(detections)

        # Control PTZ camera based on positions
        if puck_position:
            pan_angle, tilt_angle, zoom_level = calculate_ptz_angles(player_positions, puck_position)
            control_ptz_camera(pan_angle, tilt_angle, zoom_level)

        # Optional: Display the frame with tracking overlays
        cv2.imshow('Ice Hockey Feed', corrected_frame)
        
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

2.5 Correct Fisheye Distortion

python

def correct_fisheye_distortion(frame):
    # Implement fisheye correction logic here
    # For simplicity, this is a placeholder
    return frame  # Replace with corrected frame

2.6 Extract Positions

python

def extract_positions(detections):
    player_positions = []
    puck_position = None
    
    for detection in detections:
        if detection['class'] == 'player':
            player_positions.append(detection['position'])
        elif detection['class'] == 'puck':
            puck_position = detection['position']
    
    return player_positions, puck_position

2.7 Calculate PTZ Angles

python

def calculate_ptz_angles(player_positions, puck_position):
    # Logic to calculate the angles based on positions
    # For simplicity, using dummy values
    pan_angle = 0  # Calculate based on player_positions and puck_position
    tilt_angle = 0
    zoom_level = 1  # Adjust zoom based on distance to puck

    return pan_angle, tilt_angle, zoom_level

2.8 Main Execution Block

python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = initialize_ai_model()
    camera_feed = "http://your-camera-feed-url"  # Replace with actual feed URL
    process_video_feed(camera_feed)

Final Notes

    Integration with CodeProject.AI: Ensure that the AIModel class and its methods align with the actual API provided by CodeProject.AI. Adjust the imports and initialization as needed.

    PTZ Camera Control: The camera control functionality depends on the specific API of your PTZ camera. Adjust the URL and data structure accordingly.

    Fisheye Correction: Implement fisheye distortion correction using OpenCV's calibration techniques if required. The placeholder function can be replaced with actual correction logic.

    Testing and Optimization: Test the system thoroughly in both indoor and outdoor environments to fine-tune the AI model for accuracy and responsiveness.

    Performance Considerations: For real-time processing, consider using threading or asynchronous methods to handle video feed and camera control separately for lower latency.

This code provides a foundational structure for developing the AI-driven automated tracking system. You can expand upon each component based on specific requirements and integrations.
